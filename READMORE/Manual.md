# Mod Buttons
Using Mod X and Mod Y, you can unlock analog capabilities on your keyboard. When using the 4 normal directions, up, down, left and right, they act like "Walk" buttons. They will input a slight tilt (70% tilt to be exact) which will cause you to walk, pivot, not fastfall, and not fall through platforms (although this last one isn't really a problem). In Melee, Mod X and Mod Y are different for these 4 directions, but Rivals doesn't have any requirement to do so.

## Mod X
The modifiers differentiate themselves when doing diagonal inputs. Mod X will cause the diagonals to "hug" the x axis, going at 20 degree angles above and below the x axis at 70% tilt. See the Mod X image in READMORE for a visual. This gives you a wavedash almost directly between 0 and 45 degrees, the shallowest Zetterburn UpB angle (15 degrees), and the ability to hold diagonally without crouching or inputting a vertical attack. (By default, holding diagonally down will cause a crouch, and holding diagonally up or down causes an up or down tilt/aerial/strong attack). The final thing this gives you is advanced DI angles if you want to incorporate that into your muscle memory.

## Mod Y
Mod Y causes the diagonals to hug the y axis, 20 degrees away from it left and right, thus being 70 degrees away from the x axis, at 70% tilt. See the Mod Y image in READMORE for a visual. This gives you a wavedash angle almost directly between 45 and 90 degrees and the steepest Zetterburn UpB angle (75 degrees), along with some advanced DI angles.

## Zetterburn Recovery
Zetterburn's recovery has 24 angles, at increments of 15. This means with normal keyboard controls, you miss out on 2 angles that lie between each angle you're able to achieve. However, even with the current functionality of this emulator I've talked about, you still don't have all the angles, missing out on the 30 and 60 degree angles. That's where this feature comes in.

By holding any C Stick button with a modifier and a diagonal, you get a different angle. With Mod X, you get the 30 degree angle, and with Mod Y, you get the 60 degree angle. For a visual of this, see Zetterburn firefox angles. You may be able to use this feature for wavedashes or DI, but you may also end up buffering an attack with the C Stick, so I wouldn't recommend it.

## Problems
Wavedash angle doesn't directly translate to wavedash length, so I might change some of the Mod X and Mod Y angles to try and get more evenly spaced wavedash angles, which would be more distinct and more useful. Might not though idk
