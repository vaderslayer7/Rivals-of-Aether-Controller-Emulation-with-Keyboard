Basically you make a very short AHK script

Right click in the folder or something, then select New > AutoHotKey script.

Open it with notepad

Below the weird lines, type the name of the modifier you want to use and some key that will act as a placeholder for it in this format

ex. turning right alt to 6

RAlt :: 6


no semicolons or anything required 
The modifiers are:
Shift
Ctrl
Alt
Win

OR to be more specific

LShift
RShift
LCtrl
RCtrl
LAlt
RAlt
LWin
RWin

Then all you have to do is right click on the script file, hit compile, hit convert, and then you have a working .exe that will let you use modifier keys in your layout
